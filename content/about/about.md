I’m **Andriy Druk** — a software engineer and technical writer focused on building high-quality mobile and cross-platform software. I’m especially interested in applying AI in practical ways, combining on-device and cloud solutions to create tools that are efficient, reliable, and genuinely helpful.

I’m currently the Lead of the AI/ML Team at [Readdle](https://readdle.com/), working on the flagship [Spark Mail App](https://sparkmailapp.com/). Previously, I led the Android team at Spark, bringing Swift development to the Android platform and helping launch [one of the most popular email apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readdle.spark) to the Android ecosystem.

I’m also a member of the [Swift on Android Working Group](https://www.swift.org/android-workgroup/), contributing to the [Swift SDK for Android](https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-android-getting-started.html) and helping make Swift a first-class language for Android development.

I have long roots in the developer community and open source:
- [Bonjour Browser](https://github.com/andriydruk/BonjourBrowser) — a network-service-discovery utility for developers (and the related RxDNSSD library for Android).
- [Swift Android Toolchain](https://github.com/readdle/swift-android-toolchain) — enabling Swift to compile and target Android from macOS.
- [LM Playground](https://github.com/andriydruk/LMPlayground) — a sandbox for experimenting with large-language-model integrations and prototyping intelligent app features.

If you’d like to chat about Swift on Android, mobile UX, cross-platform development, or applied AI — I’d love to connect.
