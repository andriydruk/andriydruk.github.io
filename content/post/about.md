Hello everyone and welcome to [Yet Another Android Developer Blog](andriydruk.com)!

<!--more-->

I am Andriy Druk: a software engineer, writer, geek. I'm passionate about creating mobile apps and currently I'm working on [Spark Mail App] (https://sparkmailapp.com/) project at [Readdle] (https://readdle.com/) in Odessa, UA. Also, I'm creating some [tools] (http://andriydruk.com/projects) for developers and publishing them in the [Google Play] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Andriy+Druk).

I hope that this blog will be a source of useful information for you and it will help you in your future development. And of course I'm interested in your feedback, so feel free to comment on the articles.
