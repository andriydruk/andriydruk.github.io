Hi everyone. Today I wanna announce my new app [R.tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.druk.rtools). It's simple application for android developers, that provide information about device configuration. 
I believe you know about android devices fragmentation and necessity to use alternative resources to support specific device configurations. This app will help you with it.

<!--more-->

R.tools provides list of configuration qualifiers sorted by priority. You can check qualifiers that you are intrested and concatenate them to a resources folder name. Yes, I know that dozen of apps with similar functionality already exist at Google Play. But most of them are ugly or contained unnecessary advertisements or trackers. That's why I decided create a clean app with nice look. Also I see R.toors not only as tools app, but educational as well.

App provides information about all qualifiers, such us ability to change value or min  SDK version.
