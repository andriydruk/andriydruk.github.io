Hello everyone and welcome to Yet Another Android Developer Blog!

I've thought a lot about creating a blog about software development in the past. As a true engineer I spent a huge amount of time reviewing existing blogger platforms and static website generators, and finally, I've started to write articles. But first things first...

<!--more-->

First of all a few words about myself. I am a software engineer from Ukraine. Ever since I was in high school, I was interested in mathematics and programming. I received a master's degree in Software Engineering from [Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute](http://www.kpi.kharkov.ua/en/). At the moment, I hold a position of [Android Team Lead] (https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=156417157) in Kharkiv (Ukraine). Besides mobile apps development I'm responsible for trainees instruction and team management. 

As you may know, the mobile development is currently one of the most promising trends in the industry. From my point of view, it is also one of the most interesting ones. In my professional career, I faced with projects for different mobile platforms, but still my passion is Android. Perhaps you might be interested in some of my tools for developers that I publish in the [Google Play] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Andriy+Druk).

Android is an amazing system. It's really flexible, rich with APIs and rapidly developing. In this blog I would like to share with you some software design patterns, overviews of new technologies or just my thoughts about the industry.

I really hope that this blog will be a source of useful information for you and it will help you in your future development. And of course I'm interested in your feedback, so feel free to comment on the articles.
